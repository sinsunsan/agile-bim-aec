## Abstract

In this month's webinar Edward Murphy founder of Ollio The Building Performance Consultancy in the UK will give his presentation titled Building Design for the Real World: A Case Study. The case study will outline his experience in development of the design concepts and client brief for HippoDigital's new office for 90 office workers. HippoDigital are UX and Scrum Masters to the tech industry, so already comfortable with Agile Methods. However when they moved into their new office in 2018 they allowed the engaged interior architect to suggest a layout. 12 months in they found the designs simply did not work. In 2019 HippoDigital Director asked Ollio if Agile in Buildings might help arrive at a better interior arrangement for the office teams. Agile in Buildings is Ollio's adaptive consolidation of Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schweber' Agile Scrum combined with immersive Virtual Reality 3D modelling as a vehicle to involve users in the development of informed client briefs and early stage concept built environment designs. In the webinar Edward will explain how Agile in Buildings works and how using its new approaches to brief development and design thinking he took all users from top to bottom through a full User Stories, Product Backlog and Scrum Team prototyping process to inform how their new office needed to work for everyone, then rapidly test the emergent design before the whole of the organisation collectively agreed on what they should physically build out. In what transpired to be a fascinating, elegant, and wholly enjoyable journey, users worked with Ollio partnered architects to transform not just the office interior layouts but the whole way of office team working, becoming recognisably more efficient as an organisation. It all makes for what should be a very interesting and absorbing evening.

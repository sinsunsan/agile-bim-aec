## Abstract

ðŸ‘‰ **Summary :**   
During this month Agile BIM meetup,  Edward Murphy founder of Ollio,  will give a presentation called "Building Design for the Real World".  Edward have a field experience of using scrum to help the design of buildings more efficient and adapted to the users.



ðŸ‘‰  **Case study : HippoDigital's new office redesign with Agile in Building methologies:**   
  
The case study will outline his experience in development of the design concepts and client brief for HippoDigital's new office for 90 office workers.   
  
[HippoDigital](https://hippodigital.co.uk/) are UX and Scrum Masters to the tech industry, so already comfortable with Agile Methods. However, when they moved into their new office in 2018 they allowed the engaged interior architect to suggest a layout. 12 months in they found the designs simply did not work. In 2019 HippoDigital Director asked Ollio if Agile in Buildings might help arrive at a better interior arrangement for the office teams.   
  
**Agile in Buildings** is Ollio's adaptive consolidation of Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schweber' Agile Scrum combined with immersive Virtual Reality 3D modelling as a vehicle to involve users in the development of informed client briefs and early stage concept built environment designs.   
  
In the meetup,  Edward will explain how Agile in Buildings works and how to use theses new approaches to brief development and design of buildings.   
Methodologies used include [Design thinking](../en/agile-bim-method/design-thinking-lean-and-agile.md), User stories



he took all users from top to bottom through a full User Stories, Product Backlog and Scrum Team prototyping process to inform how their new office needed to work for everyone, then rapidly test the emergent design before the whole of the organization collectively agreed on what they should physically build out. In what transpired to be a fascinating, elegant, and wholly enjoyable journey, users worked with Ollio partnered architects to transform not just the office interior layouts but the whole way of office team working, becoming recognizably more efficient as an organization.   
  
It all makes for what should be a very interesting and absorbing evening.

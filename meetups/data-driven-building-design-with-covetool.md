# üå§Ô∏è Data driven building design with Covetool

Technology adoption in the AEC space typically lags far behind other industries. In this discussion, We'll highlight how to evaluate new technologies effectively and then give a practical guide for how to quickly roll out new tech into the architect's workflow on the design process. We‚Äôll try to answer two questions :

* How data can help you in the early stage ?
* How data can improve your design process ?

To illustrate this theme, we invite Patrick Chopson, Co-Founder of covetool, the automated platform performance analysis for aec industry.

✨ Design thinking is a method to ideate a project in a short timeframe, choose an idea to develop, prototype and then test the idea with the stakeholders. Design thinking emphasize the need to work with a small team with different complementary backgrounds : architect, engineer, ...** ** and who work intensively for a short period of time. 📐💼 [👷‍♀️](https://emojipedia.org/woman-construction-worker/)\
\
We think it could be a great way to handle Architecture design in a more collaborative way. And test ideally quickly at the early stage of the project but involving all the team and not only the architect.

For this month Agile BIM meetup, Pascal Chazal CEO of Magazine Hors-Site (off site) will give a presentation about off site construction.

He will emphasize how this paradigm shift in construction in linked to the organization changes in the construction industry.

* Why industrialization of construction and off-site is the future of construction
* How to think and design a building with off-site construction in mind
* How off-site can help tackle the challenge of retrofitting old buildings to cut their carbon emissions
* How off-site change the way of collaborating together and has link with agile

### Why off-site construction is important&#x20;

\
Off-site construction is at the crossroad of many themes we talked about last months :\
\* Modularization  & Open-source architecture \
\* Agile teams in construction\
\* Robotization, CNC & Maker movement\
\* AI and generative design\
\* Climate change and carbon zero construction\
\
We will see how this evolution of the construction industry will also probably change the work organization and the methods. Let's get back to agile :)

And more important off-site construction, is a unique trigger to make the construction industry finally more innovative, because of the added rentability to invest in R\&D.\
\
The immediate needs to refurbish thousands of building to make them eco-compatible is also a great field for off-site. \
\
So let's meet at the next meetup. \

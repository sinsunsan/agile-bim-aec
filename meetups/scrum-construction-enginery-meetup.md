### âœ¨ About the meetup 

When the number of customers increases \(very nice-to-have problem\) and the complexity increases, it is not easy to grow in size while maintaining excellent quality.

We need a global and shared vision of priorities, shared responsibilities, delegation, autonomy, and simple processes with an easy onboarding of new staff.

How to achieve this? Agile and Scrum sound like the solution.

We will see the never-ending journey of TWO engineering and construction companies improving themselves, moving from "resources" assigned to projects to cohesive teams of professionals capable of delighting customers in a coordinated and cross-functional way.

Thanks to understanding clients' needs, clear prioritization, transparency, and continuous improvement, these Firms are using Scrum to express the best of their potential.

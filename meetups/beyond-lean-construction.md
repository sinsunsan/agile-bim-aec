### ðŸ‘‰ About the meetup

Dee is developing a dedicated chapter to teach Scrum for architecture & construction. She will explain what is specifically challenging about this industry compared to others, and why adopting Scrum could be game changing for the industry.

She will also continue to advance the idea that Lean is not enough in the Design and Construction industry. Companies need to go beyond Lean and embrace Agile philosophy and the Scrum framework to be competitive, creative, and innovative. She has been researching and speaking on this topic throughout 2021 and looks forward to sharing what she continues to discover.

She will answer to all the questions you may have like how long it takes to switch to Scrum, what are the benefits of Scrum for AEC and much more.

And of course like always you may participate and ask question in the comment on Youtube.

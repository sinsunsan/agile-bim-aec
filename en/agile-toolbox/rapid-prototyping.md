# Rapid prototyping

Rapid prototyping is a methodology used in industry for years, but which is less common is the field of Architecture & construction. By rapidly producing a 1:1 scale prototype of an element of a construction project, we can get very qualitative feedbacks from the users. And know if the proposed design is the good one, or it needed to be modified and in which direction.   
  
Thanks to parametric design and rapid prototyping tools like 3D printers, laser Cut machine and CNC, contributed to make rapid prototyping much simpler and cheaper. Combined with agile methodologies, prototypes along with [virtual reality](project-demo.md) can be a very powerful way to design a project with constant feedbacks from the client and even final users.

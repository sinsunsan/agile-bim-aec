# Pair modeling



![Peer designing : A good way to share knowledge](../../.gitbook/assets/undraw_pair_programming_njlp.png)



### How it works?

You work at 2 co-workers on the same project in a specific session of pair working. One of the two take the lead and work while explaining to the other what he is doing. His team-mate have time to think about the process and guide the other. After a moment you alternate your roles

### Advantages of pair working

* Take a distance from your work when you are playing the observer role 
* Exchange with each other about your way of working 
* Complete the knowledge you have of the project with the other team-mate
* Motivate the team especially when working of difficult task

# Agile construction project

### Programming phase

![Design with the users](../../.gitbook/assets/agile-aec-user-l.jpg)

* Exchanges with end-users to define uses 
* Progressive definition of the program through exploratory projects 
* Gather, if possible, all the main contractors during pre-configuration meetings: Project owner, Architects, Builders, Engineers to anticipate problems. 
* Don't necessarily complete a tied program, but agree to start with a base that will evolve as the design progresses. 

**Agile Methods**: Design Thinking, Kanban Design phase

### Design phase

![Design with scrum for AEC](../../.gitbook/assets/agile-architecture-design-l.jpg)

* Work by iteration
* Bringing together all design stakeholders 
* Agree on the expectations of each iteration and obtain clear validations. 
* Demonstrate the digital mock-up at each step of the process 
* Communicate on its progress and ideally organize stand-ups meetings every day or at least once a week. 
* Use digital tools: exchange platform, instant communication tool, file sharing tool to synchronize deliverables 
* Automate checks and allow each member to benefit from the feedback of the validation tools Agile 

**Methods**: Kanban, Scrum, XP \(test driven design\)

### Construction phase

![Lean construction](../../.gitbook/assets/lean-construction-l.jpg)

* To have a daily communication on iterations between companies on site 
* Seek to optimize the flow on the site and the expenditure of materials 
* Limit waste and reuse as much as possible 
* Bringing everyone together and looking for solutions together 
* Use collaboration and sharing tools to streamline information sharing 

**Agile methods**: Lean construction, Kanban

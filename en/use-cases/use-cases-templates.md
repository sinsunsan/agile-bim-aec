# Use cases templates

### Why a template

  
We would be more than happy if you take time to write down the agile BIM workflow you did experience. So that anyone can get inspirations from you. And as a community, we could have many examples to build with and end up with an agile BIM "best practices" or "framework" document.   
  
To be able to quickly compare the approaches, it is better to follow a guide or template.   
So Here is the template you can use to write your own agile BIM use case.
